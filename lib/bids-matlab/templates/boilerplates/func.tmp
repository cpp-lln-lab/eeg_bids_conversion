For the {{TaskName}}, %s run(s) of {{PulseSequenceType}} {{ScanningSequence}} {{SequenceVariant}}
fMRI data were collected (%s slices acquired in
a %s fashion; repetition time, TR= {{RepetitionTime}} ms; echo time, TE= %s ms;
flip angle, FA= {{FlipAngle}} deg; field of view, FOV= %s mm; matrix size= %s;
voxel size= %s mm; multiband factor= %s;
in-plane acceleration factor= %s).
Each run was %s minutes in length, during which %s functional volumes were acquired.
