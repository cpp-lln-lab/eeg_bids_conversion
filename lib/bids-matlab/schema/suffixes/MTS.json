  "description": "This method is to calculate a semi-quantitative magnetization transfer\nsaturation index map.\nThe MTS method involves three sets of anatomical images that differ in terms\nof application of a magnetization transfer RF pulse (MTon or MToff) and flip\nangle ([Helms et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.21732)).\n"
