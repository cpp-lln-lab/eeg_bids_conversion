We RECOMMEND to make use of these columns, and\nin case that you do use them, we RECOMMEND to use the following values\nfor them:\n\n-   `age`: numeric value in years (float or integer value)\n\n-   `sex`: string value indicating phenotypical sex, one of \"male\", \"female\",\n    \"other\"\n\n    -   for \"male\", use one of these values: `male`, `m`, `M`, `MALE`, `Male`\n\n    -   for \"female\", use one of these values: `female`, `f`, `F`, `FEMALE`,\n        `Female`\n\n    -   for \"other\", use one of these values: `other`, `o`, `O`, `OTHER`,\n        `Other`\n\n-   `handedness`: string value indicating one of \"left\", \"right\",\n    \"ambidextrous\"\n\n    -   for \"left\", use one of these values: `left`, `l`, `L`, `LEFT`, `Left`\n\n    -   for \"right\", use one of these values: `right`, `r`, `R`, `RIGHT`,\n        `Right`\n\n    -   for \"ambidextrous\", use one of these values: `ambidextrous`, `a`, `A`,\n        `AMBIDEXTROUS`, `Ambidextrous`\n\nThroughout BIDS you can indicate missing values with `n/a` (for \"not\navailable\").\n"
