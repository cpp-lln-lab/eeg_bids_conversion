  "description": "The time at which each slice was acquired within each volume (frame) of the\nacquisition.\nSlice timing is not slice order -- rather, it is a list of times containing\nthe time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in relation to the beginning\nof volume acquisition.\nThe list goes through the slices along the slice axis in the slice encoding\ndimension (see below).\nNote that to ensure the proper interpretation of the `SliceTiming` field,\nit is important to check if the OPTIONAL `SliceEncodingDirection` exists.\nIn particular, if `SliceEncodingDirection` is negative,\nthe entries in `SliceTiming` are defined in reverse order with respect to the\nslice axis, such that the final entry in the `SliceTiming` list is the time\nof acquisition of slice 0. Without this parameter slice time correction will\nnot be possible.\n",
